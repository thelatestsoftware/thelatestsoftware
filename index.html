					<h2>SketchBox | macOS</h2>
					<p>Mozilla Firefox (or simply Firefox) is a free and open-source web browser developed by The Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD,illumos and Solaris operating systems. Its sibling, Firefox for Android, is also available. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface. An additional version, Firefox for iOS, was released on November 12, 2015. Due to platform restrictions, it uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko, as with all other iOS web browsers.

					<h2>Anxiety | macOS</h2>
					<p>Anxiety is a new to-do list app built specifically for Leopard. It synchronizes well with Mail and iCal and serves up a discreet yet attractive interface.

					The application makes use of Leopard's Calendar Store function so syncing with both Mail and iCal works seamlessly. We enjoyed the sleek dark grey interface, which lists up tasks, with the total number appearing at the bottom of the window. You can check or uncheck these and swap between different lists by clicking on the drop down title list.

					Anxiety also makes it very easy to create and add new notes in a second. You can also choose to have the program's icon appear either in your menu bar or on the Dock. Anxiety can hide away when inactive and appear at login.

					Anxiety is a simple, unassuming yet attractive to-do list which syncs perfectly with Mail and iCal.
